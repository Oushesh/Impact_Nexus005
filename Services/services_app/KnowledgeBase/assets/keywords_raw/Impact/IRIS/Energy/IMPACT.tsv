# Energy
## Description: Themes in Energy include Strategic Goals and Delivery Models that that seek to reduce GHG emissions, reduce consumption of fossil fuels, minimize over-consumption of energy and fuel resources through conservation, or some combination of these, equitably sharing the benefits arising from these activities. Themes in Energy also include Strategic Goals and Delivery Models that seek to provide all individuals with consistent access to sufficient, safe, and reliable energy to meet basic needs and preferences.
## Also known as:
## • Access to energy
##
## DELIVERY MODELS
## Businesses or projects for the themes in this category include the following
## • Generation, transmission, distribution, and storage of energy from renewable sources, including wind, solar, geothermal, biomass,8  waste energy, wave and tidal, small-scale hydropower, and renewable fuels
## • Products, services, and technologies to provide quality energy access (both on- and off-grid) at lower cost to underserved groups and communities (including lighting, phone charging, household appliances, etc.)
## • Energy-efficient materials, products, and equipment
## • Fuel-efficient transport and public transport
## • Energy management (for renewable energy facilities and power plants)
## • Waste-to-energy
##
## DELIVERY MODELS NOT INCLUDED
## • Non-renewable
## • Products and services for industrial automation
## • Household appliances powered by nonrenewable energy
## • Sustainable urban design or green buildings (see Real Estate)
##
## STRATEGIC GOALS
## For theme: Energy Access
## • Improving lighting for business
## • Improving energy alternatives for cooking
## • Improving energy alternatives for healthcare
## • Improving lighting for homes
## • Improving energy for connectivity
## • Reducing harmful emissions from smallscale energy sources
##
## Strategic Goals under the Clean Energy and Energy Efficiency themes are planned for future development.
