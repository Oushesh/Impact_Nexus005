"Raw cement asbestos (RCA) undergoes a complete solid state transformation when heated at high temperatures.
The secondary raw material produced, high temperatures-cement asbestos (HT-CA) is composed of newly-formed
crystals in place of the asbestos fibers present in RCA. Our previous study showed that HT-CA exerts lower
cytotoxic cell damage compared to RCA. Nevertheless further investigations are needed to deepen our understanding
of pathogenic pathways involving oxidative and nitrative damage.
Our aim is to deepen the understanding of the biological effects on A549 cells of these materials regarding DNA damage related proteins
(p53, its isoform p73 and TRAIL) and nitric oxide (NO) production during inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-mediated inflammation.
 Increments of p53/p73 expression, iNOS positive cells and NO concentrations were found with RCA, compared to HT-CA and controls mainly at 48 h.
 Interestingly, ferrous iron causing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated DNA damage was found in RCA as a contaminant.
HT-CA thermal treatment induces a global recrystallization with iron in a crystal form poorly released in media. HT-CA slightly interferes with
genome expression and exerts lower inflammatory potential compared to RCA on biological systems. It could represent a safe approach for storing
or recycling asbestos and an environmentally friendly alternative to asbestos waste"
