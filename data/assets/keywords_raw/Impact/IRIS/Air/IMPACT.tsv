# Air
## Description: Themes in Air include Strategic Goals and Delivery Models that seek to address air quality issues by addressing stratospheric ozone depletion, reducing toxic emissions such as NOX and SOX, mitigating the environmentally harmful by-products to protect the environment and human health, and sharing the benefits of these activities equitably
## Also known as:
## • Air Quality
## • Reduced Air Pollution
## • Access to Clean Air
## • Ambient Air Quality
## • Ozone layer protection
##
## DELIVERY MODELS
## Businesses or projects for the themes in this category include the following
## • Manufacturing with reduced emissions (NOX, SOX)
## • Services (scrubbers)
## • Technology
## • Domestic solutions (clean cookstoves, clean light and power)
## • Fuels and Vehicles (removal of air pollutants from fuel prior to combustion, emissions control, efficiency combustion, renewable fuels)
##
## DELIVERY MODELS NOT INCLUDED
## • Forest Conservation
## • Forest Restoration
## • CO2  and other greenhouse gas reduction
##
## STRATEGIC GOALS
## • Mitigating carbon emissions from forestry and land use5
## • Mitigating climate change through carbon capture and sequestration
## • Mitigating climate change through clean electricity and heat production
## • Mitigating climate change through sustainable agriculture
## • Mitigating climate change through sustainable manufacturing
## • Mitigating climate change through clean mobility
##
## Strategic Goals under the Clean Air theme are planned for future development.
