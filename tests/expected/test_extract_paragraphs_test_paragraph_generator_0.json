    "text": "Deconstruction has strong ties to environmental sustainability. In addition to giving materials a new life cycle, deconstructing buildings helps to lower the need for virgin resources. This in turn leads to energy and emissions reductions from the refining and manufacture of new materials, especially when considering that an estimated 40% of global material flows can be attributed to construction, maintenance, and renovation of structures. As deconstruction is often done on a local level, many times on-site, energy and emissions are also saved in the transportation of materials. Deconstruction can potentially support communities by providing local jobs and renovated structures.  Deconstruction creates 6-8 jobs, for every job created by traditional demolition. In addition, solid waste from conventional demolition is diverted from landfills.  This is a major benefit because construction and demolition waste accounts for approximately 20% - 40% of the solid waste stream. 90% of this construction and demolition waste stream is generated during the process of demolition. In 2015 548 million tons of construction and demolition waste were created in the United States alone.Deconstruction allows for substantially higher levels of material reuse and recycling than does conventional processes of demolition. Up to 25% of material in a traditional residential structure can be readily reused, while up to 70% of material can be recycled.",

    "text": "Structural deconstruction involves dismantling the structural components of a building. Traditionally this had only been performed to reclaim expensive or rare materials such as used brick, dimension stone, and extinct wood. In antiquity, it was common to raze stone buildings and reuse the stone; it was also common to steal stones from a building that was not being totally demolished: this is the literal meaning of the word dilapidated. Used brick and dimension limestone, in particular, have a long tradition of reuse due to their durability and color changes over time. Recently, the rise of environmental awareness and sustainable building has made a much wider range of materials worthy of structural deconstruction.  Low-end, commonplace materials such as dimensional lumber have become part of this newly emerging market.",

Materials that cannot be salvaged may be recycled on-site or off-site, or taken to landfills. The next step involves identifying which, if any, are hazardous materials.

    "text": "As opposed to the method of demolishing a building, deconstructing a building is a much safer method for both the environment, as well as the overall health of humans in terms of air pollution. Structures are usually taken down using the method of implosion, where explosives are used to implode the building on itself. This in itself causes a variety of harmful substances to enter the atmosphere and affect our air quality. Although not done through the method of implosion, the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York City's World Trade Center serve as a good reference point to the harmful effects that come along with the demolition of such large structures such as these buildings. The reason for this is primarily because of the similarities between a controlled demolition and the way in which the Twin Towers collapsed that day. The environmental effects that followed these attacks included the release of numerous harmful and toxic particles into the air, which had a huge impact on New York City's air quality. Not only has this been detrimental to the environment, but also to the physical health of many people. In many instances, the substances that are released by these practices are directly linked to numerous diseases and illnesses found in many people who have been within a certain proximity of a demolition. Again relating to 9/11, there have been countless instances and studies performed to show how these ailments arose in 9/11 survivors. As a healthier alternative, deconstruction is used in many instances due to the fact that it does not share any of the same negative affects to the air quality with its counter method of demolition. As previously stated above, this method involves carefully taking the building apart through the dismantling of each part, ultimately reducing the amount of pollutants released into the environment, as well as aiding in the processes of recycling and waste management. It is because of this that so many believe deconstruction to be a much safer and environmentally-friendly method of taking down structures.",

This is a current trend in sustainable architecture. DfD structures typically use simple construction methods combined with high-grade, durable materials. Separating layers of a building's infrastructure and making them visible can significantly simplify its deconstruction. Making components within systems separable also assists in being able to dismantle materials quickly and efficiently. This can be achieved by using mechanical fasteners such as bolts to connect parts. Allowing physical access to these fasteners is another necessary aspect of this design, as well as the use of standardized materials assembled consistently throughout the project.",
