This Regulation sets an emission target for new passenger cars for the year 2015 (130 g CO 2 /km) -phased in from 2012 -and for the year 2020 (95 g CO 2 /km). Starting from 2012, a specific binding CO 2 target is calculated for each manufacturer every year based on the average mass of its fleet (Annex 1). In July 2012, the Commission proposed to amend the regulation with a view to defining the modalities for reaching the 2020 target to reduce CO 2 emissions from new passenger cars.",

    "content": "As a general observation, dieselisation ( 3 ), i.e. the introduction of more diesel vehicles, is one of the main drivers for the emissions reductions of the major manufacturers (Figure 2 .1). Diesel vehicles registrations have increased consistently over the years, but for some manufacturers the share of diesel cars has stabilised over the last couple of years. Despite the increasing trend, the share of alternative fuelled vehicles remains low and hence has not contributed significantly to the observed emissions reductions. For some manufacturers a shift to smaller vehicles (downsizing -a reduced engine capacity) is also observed, for example for BMW, Fiat and Volkswagen. Table 2 .2 presents data by manufacturer pool. The majority of the pools were already in place in 2011, while Toyota-Daihatsu Group, VW Group PC and Tata Motors Ltd, Jaguar Cars Ltd, Land Rover (TJL) will pool as from 2012. These pools are reported here because data registered in 2011 are compared with the 2012 target. For some pools, the difference between the average emissions of the pool members is quite high. The smallest range is found in the Ford-Werke pool, where the average emission of the individual manufacturers varies between 114 g CO 2 /km and 132 g CO 2 /km -a difference of 18 g CO 2 /km. By contrast, the difference between the manufacturers in the Volkswagen pool is more than 265 g CO 2 /km. The distance of manufacturers to their specific emissions targets is calculated by taking into account the adjustments listed in chapter 1 (phase in, super-credits, E85 reductions and eco-innovations).",
